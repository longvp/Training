Hi guys !!! 
1. In this tutorial you are going to learn how to create the beautiful website template and also,
Some people spend several hours a day listening to English. They know that to improve their listening , they need a lot of practice.

Unfortunately, these people usually fail to improve their listening as well.

Why is that?

Here is what usually happens:

At first, they are motivated to improve their listening. They decide to listen to English for 2 hours every day.
After a while, they have trouble finding time to practice.
Finally, they lose motivation and give up.
Because they quit too soon, their listening skills didn't improve.
This is how many "motivated" English students fail. They practice hard in the beginning, but then they quit soon afterwards because they can't maintain that kind of practice.

Here's the lesson to be learned: for your English listening skills to improve, you must listen to English regularly over a long period of time.

Listening to English for several hours per day "for a month" is not enough. You need to do it for many months (or over a year).
